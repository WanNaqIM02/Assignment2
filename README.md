# Saving Calculator

This project of mine is create a weekly savings calculator. Hence, allows the user to input their expenses,
store and retrieve them accordingly. Then once the website obtains the user's input, it would calculate it and
displat the result as a chart and outputs them info on how much more to save, whether they have reached their target 
or how much in excess savings they have. They are also able to choose the type charts they want their results to be displayed
in.

## Design Process

### User
---
Hence, the website is intended to be intuitive to anyone. Therefore, this website can be utilised by working adults, students or 
even children to enable them to plan their budget efficiently. Hence, the website designed should be minimal and intuitive.

### User Stories
---
* As an user, the inputs should accept numbers so that any character other than a number I mistyped does not appear in the input.
* As an user, I want to be able to choose the type of charts i want my result to be displayed in.
* As an user, I want my preferences and inputs to be saved when the website loads.
* As an user, I want to be able to remove my saved inputs and reset my inputs.
